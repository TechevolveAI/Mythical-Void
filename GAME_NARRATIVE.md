# Mythical Void - Game Narrative & World Building

## Core Narrative

### The Arrival
You are a human explorer whose ship catastrophically malfunctioned while traversing the mysterious region of space known as "The Void" - a cosmic anomaly at the edge of our solar system that few have dared to cross. Your crash landing on this unnamed planet beyond The Void wasn't just survival against the odds - it was destiny.

### First Contact
Among the wreckage of your ship, as you gather your bearings on this alien world, you discover something extraordinary: a luminescent egg, pulsing with an otherworldly energy. This isn't just any egg - it's a remnant of an ancient civilization of mythical creatures that once thrived on this planet.

### The Mission
Your discovery reveals a profound truth: you're not just a survivor, you're potentially the key to reviving an entire species. The creature that hatches from this egg becomes your companion, guide, and partner in:
